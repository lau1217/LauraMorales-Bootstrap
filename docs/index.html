            <h3>Mary Read: Defying Gender Norms</h3>
            <p class="lead">Mary Read started as a bastard child and became one of the most prolific pirates in history</p>
            <p class="byline">By Laura Morales</p>
            <p> Read was born in England in 1685. She began dressing as a boy at a young age, at first at her mother's urging in order to receive inheritance money and then as a teenager in order to join the British military. She then married and upon her husband's death moved to the West Indies around 1715. In 1720 she met Jack Rackham and joined his crew, dressing as a man alongside Anne Bonny. Her time as a pirate was successful but short lived, as she, Bonny and Rackham were arrested in November 1720. Although Rackham was swiftly executed, both Read and Bonny claimed to be pregnant and received delayed sentences. Read died of a fever in April 1721, likely due to complications from the pregnancy. <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history if-theres-a-man-among-ye-the-tale-of-pirate-queens-anne-bonny-and-mary-read-45576461/ "> Check out more on the Smithsonian website!</a></p>
